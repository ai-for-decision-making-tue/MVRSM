# MVRSM #

MVRSM uses a piece-wise linear surrogate model for optimisation of expensive cost functions with continuous and discrete variables.

`MVRSM_minimize(obj, x0, lb, ub, num_int, max_evals, rand_evals)` solves the minimisation problem

**min** *f(x)*

**st.** *lb<=x<=ub, the first num_int variables of x are integer*

where `obj` is the objective function, `x0` the initial guess,
`lb` and `ub` are the bounds, `num_int` is the number of integer variables,
and `max_evals` is the maximum number of objective evaluations (`rand_evals` of these
are random evaluations).

It is the mixed-variable version that is related to the [DONE algorithm](https://bitbucket.org/csi-dcsc/donecpp/src/master/), 
meant for problems with both continuous and discrete variables.

## How to run ##

Run the file `demo.py` directly, or indicate an existing test function to optimise, for example:

`python demo.py -f dim10Rosenbrock  -n 10 -tl 4`

Here, `-f` is the function to be optimised, `-n` is the number of iterations, and `-tl` is the total number of runs.
Currently the following test functions are already supported:
'func2C', 'func3C', 'dim10Rosenbrock', 'linearmivabo', 'dim53Rosenbrock', 'dim53Ackley', 'dim238Rosenbrock'

Afterward, use `plot_result.py` for visualisation (set the correct folder and other parameters inside the file).
